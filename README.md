> Problem statement :
- Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours. <br>
- This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.<br>
- You can use R, Python, SAS Enterprise Miner or any other tool.<br>
- What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day? <br>

<br>

> Problem Statement :
- Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.<br>
- The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to
predict the right class accordingly. <br>
- Use R or Python or perform this task<br>
